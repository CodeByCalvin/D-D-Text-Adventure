<h2>Project Brief</h2>

The aim of this project is to create a text based adventure game using Object Oriented Programming techniques in JavaScript. Extra bragging rights will be awarded for creativity in the subject and presentation of your game.

<h2>Your Project</h2>

The quiz should be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The quiz should include the following functionality:

1. A Single HTML page. The user should not move from the page when playing the game.
2. The ability to move around the game to different “rooms”.
3. The display of a description of the room when the adventurer enters the room.
4. The display of a description of any objects or characters who are in the room.
5. The ability to interact with characters and /or objects / rooms in the game (e.g. fight a character, solve a puzzle, collect an object).
6. The ability to “lose” the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a character, object or room).
7. The ability to “win” the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a character, object or room).

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
- The address for the GitHub repository. 
<br> - The address for the GitHub pages.

<h2>Extension</h2>
Create a win condition that is dependent on several actions during the game (defeat several enemy characters, collect objects from friendly characters and defeat a final “boss” character). Reuse the classes and methods to create a second game in a different setting (the second game could be much simpler and only include navigation around the setting).
